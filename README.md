## How to Run the Project
Download the project zip file to you computer and unzip the file. Or clone this
repository to your desktop.

Open the text-based interface for your operating system (e.g. the terminal
window in Linux, the command prompt in Windows).

Navigate to the project directory and then enter the `vagrant` directory.

### Bringing the VM up
Bring up the VM with the following command:

```bash
vagrant up
```

The first time you run this command it will take awhile, as the VM image needs to
be downloaded.

You can then log into the VM with the following command:

```bash
vagrant ssh
```

More detailed instructions for installing the Vagrant VM can be found
[here](https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud197/install-vagrant).

### Make sure you're in the right place
Once inside the VM, navigate to the t directory properties_dekho with this command:

```bash
cd /vagrant/properties_dekho
```

### OAuth setup
In order to log in to the web app, you will need to get either a Google+ or Facebook
(or both) OAuth app ID and secret. For Google, go to the
[Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and for Facebook,
go to [Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/products/login).

Once you have your credentials, put the IDs and secrets in the `fb_client_secrets.json`
file for Facebook and `client_secrets.json` for Google.


You will now be able to log in to the app.

### Run database_setup.py
```bash
python database_setup.py
```
To create an empty database with name `propertieswithusers.db`

### Run create_statements_with_users.py
```bash
python create_statements_with_users.py
```
to populate the database with some projects with properties having a dummy user.

### Run final_project.py
```bash
python final_project.py
```

It then starts a web server that serves the application. To view the application,
go to the following address using a browser on the host system:

```
http://localhost:5000/
```

You should see the  Projects with their Properties were added to the database. Go ahead and explore the web site. To add a Project or Property, you'll need to log in first with either a Google or Facebook account.
